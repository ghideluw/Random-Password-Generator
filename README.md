Password generator Application
The purpose of this application is to create a password generator using javascript tools added to enhance the functionality of the index.html and CSS code . The password will be randomized combination of letters (both upper and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. The code will specify the type of requirements including length, character style and type to be used in the password output. Once the requirements are specified and fulfilled, the generator will be able to output a secure password of minimum length 8 characters.
